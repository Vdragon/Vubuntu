# CDRTools : Brandon Snider
# https://launchpad.net/~brandonsnider/+archive/ubuntu/cdrtools
# This PPA contains builds of CDRTools and Smake. CDRTools has been packaged as a replacement for CDRKit. This may (or may not) solve many CD/DVD burning issues in Ubuntu.
# 
# The CDRTools package builds Cdrecord, which replaces Wodim, and Mkisofs, which replaces Genisoimage.
# 
# Instructions: Add the PPA, update your sources and then install cdrecord and mkisofs. If you want to go back to cdrkit, install genisoimage and wodim.
# 
# As of 3.01a21, with the help of Jorg Schilling and Clement Lefebvre, the packaging includes scripts that mimic Genisoimage, Readom, and Wodim, so that Brasero should function with all features enabled. Other apps should as well. Mkisofs, when used with the old options -L -H -P, which were still used by Genisoimage, has been patched upstream to function with the -legacy flag. The flag is passed by the Genisoimage script, if necessary.
